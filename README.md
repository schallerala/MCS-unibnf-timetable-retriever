To ease the selection of classes, create a few shell and TypeScript scripts
to retrieve the classes present on https://mcs.unibnf.ch/.


## How it works
1. Compile with
```shell
npm run compile
```
This will output the TypeScript files in the `dist` folder.

## Formatted result in GSheet
If you are lazy, just copy the resulting GSheet:
